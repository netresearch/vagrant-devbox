  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
    vb.cpus = 4
    vb.memory = 8192

  config.vm.provider "vmware_fusion" do |vm|
    # Display the vmware GUI when booting the machine

    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
    vm.vmx["memsize"] = 8192
    vm.vmx["numvcpus"] = 4
  end

  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # such as FTP and Heroku are also available. See the documentation at
