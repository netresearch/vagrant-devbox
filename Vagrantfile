  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
    vb.cpus = 4
    vb.memory = 8192
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.
